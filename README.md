# Traffic Light Simulation in C#

This project implements a basic traffic light simulation in C# using Windows Forms.

## Project Description

The project simulates the operation of a traffic light with three states: red, yellow, and green. It utilizes timers to control the light changes and blinking.

## Features

- Automatic transition between red, yellow, and green lights.
- Blinking effect before transitioning to the next state.
- Utilization of timers to control light changes and blinking.

## Code Organization

The code provided in this project is organized as follows:

- **Form1.cs**: Contains the main logic of the traffic light.
  - Implements timers to control light changes and blinking.
  - Defines events associated with each timer to switch between traffic light states.
